# Zomato-Recommendation-App

In this project I created a web application that can recommend a restaurant based on the restaurant you liked earlier.
I collected the data using **Web-scrapping** from Zomato-Api. I scrapped following features to make a dataset Name of restaurant, It's cuisines, Reviews List, Rating.
Then the data was preprocessed and saved in the csv file. I used the dataset to **train the model** using **cosine similarity**. I deployed my model using the **Flask** framework on Heroku Cloud Platform.
